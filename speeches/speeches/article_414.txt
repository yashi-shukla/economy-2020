Bharat Mata Ki Jai for Mighty India!

Governor of Uttar Pradesh Shri Ram Naik ji; the popular and enthusiastic Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Shri Yogi Adityanath, the Deputy Chief Minister; my colleague in the Parliament, our mentor and senior leader, Respected Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi ji; Ministers of the UP Government, Bhai Satish ji and Satyadev ji; State President of Bharatiya Janata Party and my colleague in the Parliament Dr. Mahendra Pandey Ji; Mr. Devendra Singh Ji, Mayor Pramila Ji and my dear brothers and sisters of Kanpur who have come here in large numbers to shower their blessings.
Yesterday I was flagging off the Metro in Nagpur and today I am inaugurating the Metro project in Kanpur.
Brothers and sisters,
I salute the land of Kanpur which is situated at the banks of Mother Ganga. Kanpur has shaped the lives of several brave-hearts and sons since the freedom struggle to an independent India. Kanpur has inspired many freedom fighters like Nana Peshwa, Tantia Tope and Rani Lakshmibai. Similarly, Kanpur has provided a direction to the lives of Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyay ji, Late Atal Bihari Vajpayee ji, and the incumbent President Ramnath Kovind ji.



Friends,
You all have built this city as an important industrial city with its labour force and strength. You have given the identity of 'Manchester of East' to Kanpur. I have got the opportunity to be present among you all to further strengthen this identity, the day-to-day life of Kanpur, the business here as well as to give strength to the enterprises here. A short while ago, projects worth thousands of crores of Rupees related to the development of Kanpur and Uttar Pradesh have been inaugurated and foundation-stones have been laid. All these projects are associated with various facilities like traffic, electricity, new enterprises, cleanliness of Ganga, cleanliness of the city, and giving houses to the poor. Besides, the metro lines in Lucknow and Agra have also been dedicated and the foundation stone has been laid in Kanpur's land today. All the work here for development is going to bring a major change in the lives of the people of Uttar Pradesh.
Brothers and sisters,
Kanpur is an industrial city and a good electricity supply system is its priority. You all are well aware of the condition of electricity supply in Uttar Pradesh earlier. Now the way Yogi ji's government has worked on electricity, the people here and the entrepreneurs have got rid of the electricity related issues. The Panki Power project is an example of how politicians had played politics with electricity. One unit of this project was set up 52 years back. How many years back? People of Kanpur must remember these things. The first unit of this project was set up how many years back? And the second unit was set up 43 years back. Even the machines get worn out after working for so long. As a result, 1 unit of electricity used to cost Rs.10 and it was also consuming more coal. It was important to change this situation.
Friends,
The extension work of Panki Power Project at a cost of approximately Rs.6000 crores has begun from today. The electricity that will be produced will be available at less than half the price and will also cut on the pollution. And brothers and sisters of Kanpur! You all are aware of the way we work. Isn't it? We ensure that the project, whose foundation stone has been laid, is inaugurated too. This means within 3 years, when this factory will be completed, we will also inaugurate it.
Brothers and sisters,
Our government is emphasizing upon distributing the electricity to every household besides helping the enterprises. Under the Saubhagya scheme, so far more than 75 lakhs people in UP have been provided with free electricity connections. If we talk only about Kanpur, more than 1.5 lakh households have been provided with free electricity, removing darkness from the lives of the people. The government is trying to ensure that farmers and the ordinary citizens receive sufficient electricity. I am astonished as to how the government used to be run earlier. In an industrial city like Kanpur, 1.5 lakh houses used to be shrouded in darkness after dusk. If those governments had the intent of doing something for the welfare of the poor, then this darkness would have been eliminated long ago.



Friends,
Let me give you an example of their lack of intent with the help of Kanpur city. You have seen for yourself, how thousands of crores of rupees had been wasted in the name of cleaning Mother Ganga. Who took away that money? Did that go waste or into someone's pocket? But brothers and sisters, the government's treasury became empty, yet Mother Ganga didn't become cleaner. Isn't it true or not? Things started changing, when in 2014, the people of India especially the people of Uttar Pradesh had given us the opportunity to serve the nation. Things started getting better after that. We are day and night engaged in the task of making Mother Ganga clean from Gangotri to Ganga Sagar with complete commitment, dedication and devotion. Under the Namami Gange Mission, work on about 275 projects is underway across the country, of which more than 50 projects are in U.P alone at the banks of river Ganga.
Friends,
Looking at the condition of Ganga in Kanpur, people used to say that it was impossible to change the situation. But our government assured the nation that the impossible can be turned into something possible. For that a strategy was framed and worked upon. A massive campaign has been started by our government to divert and treat the waste water and the effluent from the houses and industries flowing into Mother Ganga in Kanpur. One of the largest drains of Asia that was directly flowing into Mother Ganga has been stopped. Several projects related to treatment of the sewage generated from the households and the cleanliness and beautification of Ghats have either been inaugurated or the foundation stones have been laid.



Friends,
Under the Namami Gange project, our government has framed a special scheme for the leather industry. Under this scheme, the foundation stone of a huge plant to treat the waste water being produced from the leather industries has been laid today. With this, everyday 2 crore litres of waste water flowing into Ganga will be prevented.
Friends,
Our government is not only protecting the old and existing industries but also encouraging the growth of new enterprises in Kanpur and the entire U.P. The Defence Corridor started in U.P will benefit Kanpur the most. Kanpur will get a boost. The environment of investment is becoming more favourable because Yogi ji has taken steps to curtail the criminal activities and is promoting the development of modern infrastructure. A network of roads, highways, expressways, railways and airways is being laid throughout U.P. At the same time, metro rail facilities are being developed in the cities. Several metro projects in U.P. including the Kanpur metro project have been approved by the central government. On the completion of the Kanpur Metro project, the traffic system here will have an unprecedented transformation.
Today with the help of technology, the second phase of the Lucknow Metro has been inaugurated. With this, now the metro will run on a 23 km route in Lucknow. Similarly, the foundation stone of the metro track has been laid in Agra. The Metro rail in Agra will not only make the lives of the people easier but will also boost the tourism.
Friends,
Out government is striving hard to provide every facility to the city of Kanpur. Today several poor families of Kanpur have been given their own houses. Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, so far approximately 1.5 crore houses have been constructed across the country. In comparison to this, the previous government could construct only 25 lakh houses in the same time while this government has constructed 1.5 crore houses. Even in U.P, after Yogi ji's government came to power, the construction of the houses is going on at a rapid pace. Otherwise, previously, we had been writing letters to the government of UP. Time and again the central government was writing letters but the people governing U.P at that time were not concerned about the poor.
Friends,
On this occasion, as I am handing over the houses to these families, from Kanpur, I wish to reiterate my promise to those poor families who have still not received their houses. After forming the government in 2014, we had said that by 2022 when India will be celebrating 75 years of Independence, there would not be any family without a pucca house in India. Today, with a great sense of responsibility, I would like to tell my poor brothers and sisters that by working at a fast pace, we have constructed 1.5 crore houses compared to their 25 lakh houses. Houses are still being constructed. Houses will also be constructed in the future. Those who haven't got their houses will receive it tomorrow, those who wouldn't receive tomorrow will get 15 days later or after a month but before 2022. Have faith that till Modi is there, it is possible. Everyone will receive their houses. Those governments who used to provide only lip-service are gone. Now the government that believes in action and work is present before you.



Friends,
Today, as I am here on the soil of Kanpur, it is pertinent to commemorate those brave-hearts whose sacrifices have made the country secure; and the nation is moving on the path of development. From the soil of Kanpur, once again I salute our Shyam Babu who was martyred in the Pulwama terror attack and brother Deepak Pandey who was martyred in the Badgam helicopter crash.
I will say 'Shahido' and you all will say loudly -' Amar rahe!' 'Amar Rahe!'
'Shahido! Amar Rahe! Amar Rahe!'
'Shahido! Amar Rahe! Amar Rahe!'
'Shahido! Amar Rahe! Amar Rahe!'
Friends,
Do you remember what happened after the Pulwama Terror attack? You all were filled with pride with the valour shown by our brave soldiers. Didn't you feel that India too has the power? Our armed forces are capable of doing what they intend to do. Are you all happy? Has your morale been boosted? Are you zealous? But brothers and sisters it is unfortunate that within our country, there are people who are trying to demean the valour of our armed forces. Shouldn't these people be ashamed of themselves? But they are not! Should we forgive those Indians who talk in a language and tone that makes Pakistan happy? Can we? Isn't that an insult to the army? Isn't that an insult to the valour of our soldiers?
Brothers and sisters,
There are a few people who are deliberately doing this. I am putting serious allegations against them from the soil of Kanpur, from Kanpur which played a crucial role during the freedom struggle. The kind of rhetoric these people are using to gain political brownie points, the kind of language that they are using and filthy allegations that they are raising against the government, are giving more power to the nation's enemies. The terrorists are taking advantage of the rhetoric used by the political opponents against Modi for political interests. Friends! Elections will come and go but it is the responsibility of every Indian to see that the enemies of the nation don't take advantage of it. Isn't it? Isn't that the responsibility of every party and every political leader?
Brothers and sisters,
Today when the international community is creating pressure on Pakistan, and Pakistan has been caught red-handed in terms of promoting terrorism, and has lost face, in such a scenario, such rhetoric by our people are benefitting Pakistan. Is it right for them to do such a thing? Don't forget, Pakistan is using their statements and spreading that in the world and is misleading the world. And these people are committing this sin.
I want to tell the countrymen from the soil of Kanpur that you might have seen how our government has been taking decisions one after another against the terrorists across the border. As a result, the terrorists are staring at their end. Consequently their nervousness is increasing. As a result of this nervousness, once again yesterday they had made a heinous attempt to launch a terror attack in Jammu. Due to the strict action being taken against the terrorists, their accomplices and sympathizers are becoming panicky! In such a situation my countrymen, as an Indian, we all should remain alert and fulfil our responsibility towards the nation more than ever before.



Friends,
It is pertinent to maintain the unity of the country. You tell me, whether we should win the fight against terrorism or not? Whether should we eradicate terrorism from its root or not? Who can end this? Who can eradicate terrorism?
Brothers and sisters,
Not Modi, but the 125 crore Indians can do that! Therefore, we need an environment of unity, brotherhood, goodwill within the country. Modi will be able to take decisions only with that strength and will crush terrorism. Modi's greatest strength is unity of the country, prevailing brotherhood and goodwill. And I need your support for that. Will I get your support? We have to win this fight. And have faith that India will win. Today I congratulate Yogi ji's government. Yesterday in Lucknow, a few insane people had shown inappropriate behaviour against our Kashmiri brothers. The U.P government is investigating the issue and I congratulate Yogi ji's government for that.
I would urge the other states too to take strict action against those engaged in similar activities. We have to end terrorism. We have to eradicate terrorism from its root and move ahead with the mantra of unity.
Friends,
In order to perpetuate corruption and dynastic politics, a few people are playing the politics of 'Mahamilavat' alliance. They think of brave soldiers, poor, middle class, farmers, industries and Ganga only when they start looking out for votes. These people who are engaged in the game of 'Mahamilavat' alliance are not able to tolerate Modi who is fighting a decisive battle against terrorism, corruption and poverty. What is their problem? With whom are these 'Mahamilavat' kinds of people having issues? So they say - come, let's have a 'Mahamilavat' alliance, let's take in those who are behind the bars, those who are bound to go into prisons and those who are out on bail. Therefore, they say - let's have 'Mahamilavat', and put an end to Modi regime. While I say - come, let us together put an end to terrorism. But they say - let us put an end to Modi. We say - let's put an end to terrorism.
Friends,
I know that every person of the country including that of U.P is standing with the nation's unity and development. Once again I congratulate you all for the various development projects. I am grateful to you that you have gathered here in such great numbers to shower your blessings! I can see a wave of people wherever my eyes can reach. Say aloud with me -
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Thanks a lot!
