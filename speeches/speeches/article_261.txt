Bharat Mata ki jai!
Bharat Mata ki jai!
Bharat Mata ki jai!
All the dignitaries present on stage and all my dear brothers and sisters who have come from far-fetched areas in large numbers.After the formation of the new government, Jharkhand is one of the few states that I have got the opportunity to visit first. I remember, it was morning time and we were all doing yoga and a light rainfall was also blessing us at this very Prabhat Tara Maidan. Today when I came to this ground again, many old memories flashed before my eyes. This is the ground from where Ayushman Bharat scheme was launched last September.Friends,
Today I am fortunate to add one more thing to the identity of Jharkhand. Brothers and sisters, your Jharkhand is going to be known as the launching pad for major schemes pertaining to the welfare of the poor and tribal communities. That is, when there will be a discussion in the country about which state started the major schemes related to the poor, the name of Jharkhand will come up in most of the discussions. The world's largest health assurance scheme Ayushman Bharat was started from Jharkhand and today lakhs of people of the country who could not get treatment due to lack of money have been treated. They are showering their blessings. That blessing is also reaching Jharkhand.
Today, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Mandhan Yojana, which ensures pension to crores of farmers across the country, is also starting from the land of Birsa Munda in Jharkhand. Besides, the National Pension Scheme for crores of businessmen and self-employed in the country is also being launched from Jharkhand. I congratulate the farmers and traders across the country from this great land.That is, we have given a scheme of pension to the workers of the unorganized sector of the country; later the pension scheme was launched for the farmers and thereafter for the businessmen and self-employed. In a way, we are ensuring that those sections of the society that play a major role in building the country should not face trouble in their old age. This pension scheme guarantees the same.

Friends,
Today I am also fortunate to inaugurate the Sahibganj Multi-Modal Terminal and our Minister Mr. Mansukh Mandaviya is sitting there. Many people of Santhal Pargana have also become witnesses to this very important occasion. And this project is not just about Jharkhand, it will also give a new identity to Jharkhand, the entire country as well as the world. This is not just another project, but is also giving a new option of transportation to this entire region.This terminal is an important part of the National Water Way -1 Haldia-Banaras Waterways Development Project. This waterway will connect Jharkhand not only with the whole country, but also with foreign countries. Immense possibilities of development are going to open up for the people of Jharkhand through this project. With this terminal, the tribal brothers and sisters and the farmers here will be able to take their produce now more easily to the markets across the country. Similarly, through the waterway, the produce of Jharkhand will easily reach the markets of the North Eastern states of Assam, Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya as well as the North India besides Jharkhand. This terminal will also create new employment opportunities. This waterway will prove to be very beneficial from the point of view of both progress and environment conservation and the costs of transportation by water route are much lesser than by road. Its benefit will also trickle down to every producer, businessman, and buyer.Brothers and sisters,
During the elections I had promised you to give a strong government and a government that delivers; a government that will work faster than ever before; a government that will put all its energy to meet your expectations. In the last hundred days, the country has seen its trailer; the entire film is yet to be seen.
Our pledge is to deliver water to every house and today the country has set out to fulfill the Jal-Jeevan Mission. Our resolve is to protect the rights of Muslim sisters, and within hundred days a stringent law has been enacted against triple talaq.Our pledge is that of a decisive fight against terrorism. In the first hundred days, the anti-terror law has been strengthened.Our resolve is to take Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh to new heights of development. We have started it within a hundred days.Our resolve is to send those who looted the public to their rightful place. And this is also working very fast. And some people have already gone to jail.Brothers and sisters, I said that every farmer family of the country will get the benefit of PM Kisan Samman Nidhi after the formation of new government. This promise has been fulfilled and now more and more farmers are being connected to this scheme.Today, more than 21 thousand crore rupees have been deposited in the accounts of about six and a half crore farmer families of the country. Today I am satisfied that in this entire scheme 8 lakh farmer families of my Jharkhand have also become its beneficiaries; about two and a half crore rupees have been deposited in their accounts. There is no middleman. No recommendation is needed.  It is said in Bengal ‘if you get the money then you will have to give cut-money to someone’. No.  Here the money is deposited directly into the accounts of the farmers.Brothers and sisters, today is a historic day for Jharkhand. Today, the new building of the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly has been inaugurated and the foundation stone of the new Secretariat building has also been laid. Nearly two decades after the formation of the state, the temple of democracy is being inaugurated in Jharkhand today. This is not just a building; it is not a structure of four walls; this building is such a holy place where the foundation of the golden future of the people of Jharkhand will be laid. This building is a pilgrimage for every citizen who believes in democracy. Through this temple of democracy, the dreams of present and future generations of Jharkhand will be realized. I would like the bold, brave and talented youth of Jharkhand to visit the new assembly building. Whenever one gets a chance, after four months, six months or a year, one must visit it.Friends, you must have heard a lot about the session of Parliament this time.  Every citizen of India became happy witnessing the way our Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha were run after the formation of the new government, after the formation of the new parliament. This happened because this time the Monsoon Session of Parliament was one of the most productive sessions in the history of independent India. The whole country saw how the time of Parliament was fruitfully utilized in the monsoon session. Parliament session continued till late in the night. The debate continued for hours, during which a number of important topics were intensely discussed and laws necessary for the country were enacted.Friends, the credit for the smooth functioning of Parliament also goes to all MPs, all political parties and all their leaders. I congratulate all the MPs; congratulations to the countrymen.Friends; development is our priority as well as our commitment. Our promise of development is also an equally strong intention. Today, the country is moving forward at such a great pace that has not been witnessed earlier. The kind of change that is taking place in the country today could not have been thought of before. People who used to think that they are above the law of the country, above the courts of the country, are seeking bail from the court today.Brothers and sisters, do you want to see a government that works fast like this? Are you happy with our hundred days of work? Are you happy?  Am I doing the right thing? Am I going in the right direction? I am getting your blessings and I hope I will continue to get it. It is just a beginning. Five years left; many resolutions are to be accomplished; a lot of efforts are to be made; a lot of hard work still to be done. In this process, historical schemes have been started a short while ago for the welfare of small farmers, shopkeepers and traders. I would urge small farmers, shopkeepers and traders from all over the country, including Jharkhand, to take advantage of these schemes.
Brothers and sisters,
Our government is trying to provide a shield of social security to every Indian. The government is standing with those who need help the most. Since March this year, a similar pension scheme is going on for crores of unorganized sector workers of the country. So far, more than 32 lakh labourers have joined the Shram Yogi Mandhan Yojana.

Friends,
Till five years ago, life insurance or accident insurance for the poor was beyond their imagination. One reason was the lack of information, and those who had the knowledge, on seeing high premium, had to think a hundred times. They thought they should worry about the current situation of arranging food instead of thinking about old age. We have tried to change this situation.Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Yojana and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana have been placed in front of the common man of the country for just 90 paise. Can you imagine that insurance of two lakh rupees has been ensured under both the schemes at the rate of only 90 paise per day and one rupee per month? So far, more than 22 crore countrymen have joined these two schemes and out of which more than 30 lakh are from Jharkhand. Besides, through these two schemes, claims of more than Rs.3500 crore have been received by the people so far.Brothers and sisters,
Just like insurance, treatment for serious illnesses was almost impossible for the poor person. We brought the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana under the Ayushman Bharat Yojana that was launched from Jharkhand. Under this scheme, about 44 lakh poor patients have got the benefit of treatment so far, out of which about 3 lakh people are from Jharkhand. Over 7 thousand crore rupees have been paid to hospitals for the same. The poor are getting the benefits of treatment under Ayushman Bharat and they are also free from the burden of debt. Now the poor doesn't have to go to the moneylender and pay huge amount of interest for his treatment.
Brothers and sisters, when the poor is less concerned about his daily life and the struggle minimizes in everyday life, then he gets so much strength that he starts trying to get himself out of poverty. Our government, whether it has been at the center or in Jharkhand, has made sincere efforts to make the life of the poor and the tribal society easier.
There was a time, when the children of the poor were left out of vaccination and fell prone to serious diseases with age. We started Mission Indradhanush to ensure vaccination for children even in remote areas of the country.There was a time when the poor faced difficulty in even opening a bank account. We have helped to open bank accounts of 37 crore poor people in the country through the Jan Dhan Yojana.There was a time, when it was difficult for the poor to get cheap government houses. We have built more than 2 crore houses for our poor through Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Now work is going on for 2 crore more houses.Friends,
There was a time when the poor did not have toilet facilities. We have removed that pain from the lives of poor sisters and daughters by constructing more than 10 crore toilets.
There was a time when the lives of poor sisters and daughters were getting ruined due to the kitchen smoke. We have given 8 crore gas connections free of charge, have protected their health, and have made their lives easier.
Brothers and sisters,
There is no area upon which the government has not worked. The dignity of the poor, his health, his treatment, his medicine, his insurance security, his pension, his children's education, his income, and everything else has been kept in mind. Such schemes not only empower the poor, but also infuse new confidence in life. And when we talk about confidence, the discussion on the children of our tribal society is quite natural. Today, a huge project has been started to improve the education and skills of tribal children, tribal youth and tribal daughters. The initiative to build 462 Eklavya Model Residential Schools across the country has started from here today from the soil of Jharkhand, i.e. from the land of Birsa Munda.  And its benefit will especially go to the brothers and sisters of my tribal community in Jharkhand. These Ekalavya schools are not only the medium of education for tribal children, but also the medium of honing the children's skills in different hobbies and sports. The facilities for conservation of local arts and culture are also available. You will be surprised to know that in these schools, the government will spend more than one lakh rupees every year on every tribal child. I am sure that those who will come out after learning from these schools will play a very big role in building a New India in the near future.
Friends,
Work on other means of connectivity is also underway in Jharkhand. In areas where it was difficult to come out after sun-set, today roads are being built and the streets are full of hustle and bustle. Highway Projects worth more than nine thousand crore rupees have been approved for Jharkhand alone, many of which have already been completed. In the coming days, the National Highway will be further expanded under the Bharatmala Scheme. In addition to roadways, highways and waterways, work is on to strengthen the connectivity of railways and airways.
All these works of development that have been done in the last five years has been possible because of the hard work of our friend Raghubar Das ji and his team as well as your blessings. The Raghubar Das government of Jharkhand has made every effort to bring about a change in the prevailing situation that was plagued by scams and lack of transparency in governance during the previous regime.
Brothers and sisters,
As so much is happening, may I ask you, the people of Jharkhand, to take up a responsibility as well? Since yesterday, the ‘Swachhata Hi Seva’ campaign has started in the country. Under this campaign till October 2, we have to ensure cleanliness in our homes, schools, offices, villages and in the neighborhood; but we also have to do a special work together. We have to collect single-use plastic and store it in one place. This type of plastic is the one which comes in handy only once; then it becomes useless and thus becomes a problem. By collecting all such plastic in one place, we have to get rid of that plastic.
On October 2, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, we have to remove that plastic pile. The government is mobilizing all the departments so that this plastic can be collected and recycled later. I appeal to the people of Jharkhand, the nature lovers of Jharkhand to take part in this campaign and to lead the country in liberating the country from single-use plastics.
Friends,
Now for the new Jharkhand, for the New India, we all have to work together, and have to take the country forward together.  In the next 5 years, Jharkhand will again ride a ‘double engine’ of development with this belief I conclude my speech.
 Many greetings to the people of Jharkhand and to the countrymen for the various schemes launched today and thank you all! With both fists closed and both hands up, say loudly – ‘Bharat Mata ki – Jai’! Your voice should reach every village in Jharkhand!
 
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Thanks a lot!
