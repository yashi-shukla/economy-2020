Namaskar!!
My best wishes to all of you on the 6th International Day of Yoga. The International Day of Yoga is a day of solidarity. This day sends out the message of universal brotherhood. It is the day of oneness of humanness. That, which brings us together, is Yoga. That, which narrows down distances, is Yoga.
People participating in the 'My Life - My Yoga' video blogging competition from around the world amid this Coronavirus crisis, shows the growing enthusiasm for Yoga! And how widespread it is!
Friends,
This year's theme of International Day of Yoga is 'Yoga at home and Yoga with family'. Today we are practising Yoga together with our family at our homes, staying away from mass gatherings. When children, grown-ups, youngsters, or the elderly, everyone is connected through Yoga, there is a flow of energy in the entire house. Therefore, this time the Yoga Day is also a day of emotional Yoga; it is also a day to enhance our family bonding.
Friends,
Today, the world is realising the importance of Yoga even more due to the Coronavirus pandemic. If our immunity is strong then we can more effectively defeat this disease. There are several types of Yoga Asanas to boost the immunity. Those postures increase the strength of our body and strengthen our metabolism.
But the Covid-19 virus specifically attacks our respiratory system. The one technique that helps in strengthening our Respiratory system the most is 'Pranayama', i.e. the breathing exercise. In general, the 'Anulom Vilom Pranayam' is more popular. It is also very effective. But there are many types of Pranayam. It includes Sheetali, Kapalbhati, Bhramari, Bhastrika and many more.
All these techniques and forms of Yoga help a lot in boosting both our respiratory and immune systems. Therefore, I urge you to include Pranayama in your daily practice, and also learn different Pranayama techniques in addition to the Anulom-Vilom. A large number of Covid-19 patients all over the world are resorting to these Yoga techniques today. The power of yoga is helping them to defeat this disease.
Friends,
Yoga also helps to boost our confidence and morale so that we can overcome crises and win. Yoga gives us peace of mind and also helps us to develop discipline and stamina. Swami Vivekananda used to say- "An ideal person is the one who is active even in absolute quietness and experiences complete peace even in extreme turbulent phases".
This is a great ability for any person i.e. not giving up and being in a balanced state of mind during an adversity; Yoga gives strength during these times. So, you too must have seen and realized that a practitioner of Yoga never loses patience during a crisis.
Yoga means - ‘समत्वम् योग उच्यते’, that is, Yoga is the name of staying the same and staying steadfast in every situation - favourable-unfavourable, success-failure, joy-sorrow.
Friends,
Yoga enhances our quest for a healthier planet. It has emerged as a force for unity and deepens the bonds of humanity. It does not discriminate. It goes beyond race, colour, gender, faith and nations.
Anybody can embrace Yoga. All you need is some part of your time and empty space. Yoga is giving us not only the physical strength, but also mental balance and emotional stability to confidently negotiate the challenges before us.
Friends,
If we can fine tune our chords of health and hope, the day is not far away when the world will witness the success of a healthy and a happy humanity. Yoga can definitely help us make this happen.
Friends,
As we are talking about the solution to problems through Yoga and the welfare of the world, I also want to remind you of Yogeshwar Krishna's Karmayoga. In the Gita, Lord Krishna while explaining Yoga had said- ‘योगः कर्मसु कौशलम्' i.e. Efficiency in Action is Yoga. This mantra always teaches us that yoga creates the ability to become more qualified in life. If we do our work with discipline and fulfil our obligations, it will also be a form of yoga.
Friends,
Karmayoga is further explained. It is said - युक्त आहार विहारस्य, युक्त चेष्टस्य कर्मसु।
युक्त स्वप्ना-व-बोधस्य, योगो भवति दु:खहा।।
That is, yoga means, eating the right food, playing the right sport, having the right habits of sleeping and waking up, and performing our work and duties correctly. With this Karmayoga, we get the solution to all the problems. Moreover, selfless work, the spirit of serving everyone without any selfishness is also called Karmayoga. This spirit of Karmayoga is embedded in the essence of India. The whole world has experienced this spirit of selflessness in India.
Friends,
When we move ahead with Yoga and the spirit of Karmayoga, our power as an individual, as a society and as a country also increases manifold. Today, we have to take a pledge in this spirit - we will do everything possible for our health and for the health of our loved ones. As a conscious citizen, we will move forward together as a family and as a society.
We will try to make 'Yoga at home and Yoga with family' a part of our lives. If we do this, we will certainly succeed and emerge victorious. With this belief, I wish you all a very Happy Yoga Day again!
