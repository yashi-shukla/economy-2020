Before I begin, I want you to raise your fists up in the air and say loudly with me so that the soldiers at the borders too feel that the people of Noida are with them.
Say it thrice.
For the mighty India
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
For the victorious India
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
For the brave soldiers
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
The successful and popular Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath ji, my Cabinet colleague Shri Mahesh Sharma ji; the people of Bihar's Buxar are also associated with this event, hence, the Power Minister of India from Buxar, Shri R.K Singh ji, our Minister present in Buxar, Shri Ashwini Choubey ji, MLA Tejpal Nagar ji, Pankaj Singh ji, Sister Bimla Solanki ji, Virendra Singh ji, Vijendra Singh ji and my zealous brothers and sisters who are present here in large numbers. Your excitement in worth looking at! I have a lot of respect for your enthusiasm and love. My dear brothers and sisters of Noida, you are raising the slogan of 'Modi-Modi' here while some people are losing their night's sleep.
Friends,
There was a time when Noida and Greater Noida were synonymous with looting governmentâ€™s wealth because of new scams related to authority, tender and land allocation. Earlier such news related to Noida were quiet prevalent. Isn't it? Hope you didn't mind it. But is it the truth or not? Today Noida and Greater Noida are known for development, projects and new employment opportunities. My nation, my Uttar Pradesh is actually transforming and moving ahead.
Brothers and sisters,
Today, Noida is developing as a major hub of Make in India. Today India has reached number two in mobile phone manufacturing in the world; Noida has played a big role in it. Prior to 2014, there were only two factories in the country that manufactured mobile phones and today nearly 125 factories are manufacturing mobile phones in the country. The stark contrast between 2 and 125! Of these, several factories are located in Noida. Besides mobiles, there are several companies of electronic items like T.V and fridge. They have created lakhs of new employment opportunities for young friends.
Friends,
Today I am present amidst you all in Noida to dedicate all those projects that promise to make your lives easier. Moreover, the foundation stones of important projects to transform Western U.P and Bihar have been laid a short while ago. I congratulate the people here for the metro running between Noida City Centre and Noida Electronic City.
Friends,
The country's largest airport is being constructed in Jewar in order to improve the connectivity here. Several processes related to it are being completed at a rapid pace. This will connect Noida to other cities via airways. Then the people will not have to go to Delhi. I believe that the Jewar airport will bring a golden opportunity for Western UP.
I am extremely pleased to inform you that in the next few weeks, flights will begin to take off from Bareilly under the UDAN scheme. The terminal building and other related works have been completed for this.

Friends,
Under the UDAN scheme with the objective of 'Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik' (let the common citizen of the country fly), so far 120 routes have been started. Due to this scheme, several tier-2 and tier-3 cities of the country now have air connectivity. This is also boosting the economy of the cities.
Friends,
Modern infrastructure related to electricity is also essential for industrial development. The foundation stones of two more major power plants have been laid from here. One plant is being set up in Khurja, Bulandshahr of UP and the other one in Bihar's Buxar. The Khurja plant is being built at a cost of more than Rs.12 thousand crores and the Buxar thermal plant at a cost of nearly Rs.10 thousand crores. I can see the huge number of friends who have joined us today from Buxar through the video conference. I greet them from here and congratulate them on this auspicious occasion. The Thermal plant that is being set up in Buxar, is a part of the Prime Minister's package announced in 2015 and our vision to make Eastern India the growth engine of the country.
Brothers and sisters,
On the completion of these two plants, UP and Bihar will have surplus electricity. With the help of the Khurja plant, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh will also get electricity along with UP. Similarly, with the help of the Buxar plant, the electricity supply to the Eastern India including Bihar will improve. Another major advantage of it will be that the industries in the states too will receive electricity according to their needs. Electricity is the first need of any industry that is being set up.
Friends,
Our government is working in many areas keeping in view the country's energy needs in the 21st century. Previous governments did not prioritize it. Yesterday I have seen an example of how the power sector was ignored in the country and the energy requirements of the country were ignored.
The educated youngsters present here will understand it better. Yesterday the expansion work of the Panki Power project had started in Kanpur. But friends, you will be shocked to know that 40-50 years old machinery was being used in the Panki project. Those machines had become obsolete. Their condition had become similar to that of the Congress. Consequently, the electricity generated used to cost Rs.10 per unit. Just imagine! Today we are producing electricity with solar energy at Rs2 per unit or Rs.3 per unit while at that time electricity was being produced at a rate of Rs.10 per unit. Who was getting benefitted out of it? Yet it was going on.
Friends,
This attitude of the previous governments had taken a toll on the condition of the power sector of the country. The people of the country cannot forget those days when the breaking news flashing on television channels used to be - 'only 2-3 days' coal left in the power plants'. During this period of mismanagement in the power sector, power grids used to fail and the states used to be plunged in darkness. India felt embarrassed in the international arena. Our government has worked with a new approach and new policies to improve the power sector of the country. We focused on 4 things and have worked at 4 different levels - production, transmission, distribution and connection. If there is no production of electricity, if the transmission and distribution system is not strong enough, then howsoever we talk of providing connection, electricity cannot reach every household.

Therefore, after the formation of the government in 2014, first of all, we emphasized on increasing the production of electricity. Work began towards electricity generation through solar energy, hydro power, coal energy, nuclear energy and so on. The coal allocation that was once a part of a scam of crores of rupees, our government has now created a transparent and modern system for the auction of the same coal. While ensuring energy security for the country, we had set a target of adding 175 Gigawatt renewable energy by 2022. Working towards this goal, so far 75 Gigawatt of renewable energy has already been added.
Friends,
The government has also increased the investment in the field of electricity transmission as a result of which there has been a tremendous increase in the country's transmission network. Consequently, today the nation has not only a safe and balanced grid but we have also fulfilled the dream of 'One Nation One Grid'. And now we are moving towards the solar energy. Brothers and sisters, neither my dreams are small nor do I indulge in petty things. Our dream is - 'One World, One Sun, and One Grid'. This dream will definitely come true one day!
Friends,
Kindly listen to what I am about to say. It will be extremely useful. I am going to quote a few statistics. These statistics are really powerful. Will you listen to it carefully? Will you remember it? Sure?If you remember just this, you won't have to think about the future. You will be able to make the right choice easily. Shall I tell you? Will you remember it?
See, from 1950 to 2014 i.e. within about 65 years, a capacity of about 2.5 lakh Megawatts was developed. How much capacity and in how many years? 2.5 lakh Megawatts in 65 years! Since the time you have chosen me - friends! You will be surprised to know that on one hand are 65 years while on the other just 5 years! It has not even been 5 years after I have come to power and our government has created a capacity of more than 1 lakh Megawatts. 2.5 lakhs in 65 years and 1 lakh in 5 years! Now just imagine - if those old and exhausted people had run the government then how many decades would have passed? But now the 'New India' is striding ahead with a new momentum.
Brothers and sisters,
Due to the years of neglect of the country's power sector, this sector had become weak. As a result, whatever electricity that was being produced was not reaching the people. Our government has tried to fix this issue. We have worked on the 'UDAY' scheme. Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana has been implemented for the villages in particular and for the cities - the IPD scheme i.e. Integrated Power Development Scheme.
Due to the efforts of the government, the electricity distribution within the country is also improving. Amidst these reforms, our government has achieved its goal of delivering electricity to every village of the country. There were more than 18000 villages where electricity was not available since independence. We have brought electricity to those villages.
Likewise, under the Saubhagya Yojana, we have started a campaign to connect every household with electricity. Under this scheme, so far, 2.5 crore households have been given free electricity connections. 2.5 crore families were still living in the dark even after 70 years of independence. Our government has delivered electricity to them.

Brothers and sisters,
Tell me, are you happy that the 2.5 crore families that were living in the dark now have electricity? Are you happy? Who did this? Who did this task? This is where you go wrong. No, Modi didn't do it. The houses of 2.5 crore families now have light because of the power of your vote. It was possible due to you.
If you were not with me and of there was no strong government in Delhi that is concerned about the welfare of the poor, these 5 years would have passed and the lives of the 2.5 crore families would have been spent in darkness. There wouldn't have been anyone to raise any question. Therefore, the credit goes not to Modi but to the 125 crore Indians, i.e. to you all.
Apart from strengthening the power sector, the government has also emphasized on the modern methods to reduce the demand of power. These modern methods not only save electricity but also reduce the electricity bills of the people. We have worked towards reducing the electricity bills of the middle class families. Due to the efforts of the government, the LED bulbs that used to cost Rs.300-350 in February 2014 now cost Rs.40-50 after I came. Why did it happen? There were middlemen everywhere. Modi cracked down on the middlemen and the cost of the bulb came down from Rs.300-350 to Rs.40-50.
Tell me, all those who were looting and whose businesses had been shut down would abuse Modi or not? Whether they would conspire against Modi or not? So, who will protect me? A person protected by the 125 crore Indians is never afraid of the middlemen.
So far, about 150 crore LED bulbs have been distributed in the country by the government and private companies. As per my estimate, with this, people are saving about Rs.50 thousand crores annually in their electricity bills. You decide! Savings of Rs.50 thousand crores annually by the citizens of the country just by the removal of the middlemen is such a big task that has been accomplished!
Brothers and sisters,
Another significant task has been accomplished in Noida today. A grand campus of Deen Dayal Upadhyay Institute of Archaeology has been set up here to link our country's rich cultural heritage and civilization with research. Spread over an area of 25 acres, this complex is built in line with India's glorious past. Now research scholars and students here will be able to study every aspect such as Indiaâ€™s rich heritage, our spirituality, our temples, our scriptures, our pilgrimage zones, our crafts and art in great detail with the help of the modern facilities.
Friends,
Archaeology is like excavating the pages of history from underneath the earth and also unearthing the fragrance of history from the stones and bringing forth the historical truth through scientific evidence. Archaeology is of great importance to our glorious nation that has seen a long period of British rule as well as several attacks by foreign forces and has seen the destruction of our ancient heritage in those attacks.
Some of you might be aware of my visit to Varanasi yesterday. There, I have laid the foundation stones of development projects related to Kashi Vishwanath Dham. Around the temple of Bhole Baba, several houses had sprung up. Those of you who might have visited Kashi Vishwanath would know how narrow streets passed through it. I don't know if God felt suffocated in such conditions. That place was in a mess! The people there have elected me as their MP. So, I thought of doing something for them and I started right away.
Now go and see. We acquired those 300 properties around Bhole Babaâ€™s temple and started demolishing them. As the houses were being demolished, the temples started getting exposed. People had built walls and turned the temples into houses, into their bedrooms. As the walls were being demolished, 200-250 years old best Archaeological pieces came out. We found 40 temples!
You decide! Before me, those running the Ministry of Culture and the department of Archaeology would have been so lackadaisical. This is a living example of the same. Now, even if a single rock is touched, the people from Archaeology department will nab those persons. But in that complex of Bhole Baba, people had taken over 40 temples for 40 or 50 years! They might have the blessings of political leaders. Now tell me, will those who lost their houses love or praise Modi? But should Modi work for his image enhancement or for the welfare of Bharat Mata? Modi doesn't work with the aim that people will hail him. Modi works for the enhancement of the country's image. Now these temples are being preserved and restored. But you have seen the kind of politics that has been played.
Friends,
Those playing politics are the same people who don't accept the facts revealed before the world with the help of archaeology. These are the same people who, for their self-interests, don't care about the preservation of such ancient heritage and rituals. There are multiple examples of the same. My brothers and sisters of Noida! This is relevant to you. I want to tell you. Do you want to hear it? If you are in mood, even I am also in mood to tell you.
You will find several examples when the previous governments have given permission to buildbungalows and farm houses next to buildings of archaeological significance just to reward their claque and sycophants. You were not aware that these things used to happen, isn't it? There are several such cases in Delhi itself. If my friends in the media start looking around andstart investigating the matter, the truth will come out. Whether you will be able to show that on screen or not, whether you will be able to print it or not is a different issue. That might be your compulsion but at least find the truth. Try to find out who were those sycophants for whom such special arrangements were made.

Friends,
Since the previous governments had such an attitude, it will be wrong to expect seriousness from them in serious subjects like archaeology. I hope that following the vision of Deen Dayal ji, this institution will play a major role in linking our past to the present and the future. I have had the opportunity to do virtuous work in your campus for Deendayal Upadhyay, who gave economic and social vision for the development of the country.
Friends,
You all are well aware of how the previous governments had worked. The situation was such that half the population was deprived of gas connection and half the population didn't have bank accounts. More than half the families didn't have toilets. Several schemes were formulated and left incomplete. Consequently, India fell behind those nations that got their independence at the same time as India and had started their development journey along with India.
Brothers and sisters,
After 2014, when you had given me the opportunity to serve you as your Prime Servant, we have been moving forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
Friends,
Our government is fighting against the culture of corruption with a heavy hand and schemes are being formulated in entirety for the welfare of the common man. Therefore, today, every corrupt person has a problem with Modi. Such people are engaged in the competition of abusing this Chowkidar. They decide in the morning that if one person hurls 15 abuses at Modi, the other will hurl 16. They believe that abusing will help them to garner votes. Moreover, their morale has plunged to such levels that they have started going against the nation in the process of opposing Modi.
Friends,
Today India is walking on the path of a new culture and new policy. After the Uri attacks, India taught the terrorists a lesson in the same language that they understood with surgical strikes. You tell me, did I take a correct step or not? Shouldnâ€™t have I done it? Do you accept a government that is in a deep slumber? Would you accept if the Chowkidar slept? Do you want an alert and awake Chowkidar or not? Do you want a Chowkidar that makes the nation victorious or not?
Brothers and sisters,
They have been demanding proof after Uri! After the Pulwama attack, the work done by our soldiers had never been done for the past several decades. Our brave soldiers have thrashed the terrorists inside their house. The terrorists didn't expect such retaliation from India. They thought that Modi had conducted surgical strike last time, so even this time he would do something similar. So they placed tanks and what not on the borders. They made all the arrangements on the border but we reached via air. Just see the fun - we had quietly made the arrangements. It was 3.30 am at night. Why to wake the people up?
But this was such a major event that at 3.30 am, Pakistan lost its sleep. We were quite. We thought - 'let's wait and watch'. Pakistan was so frightened that by 5 am it started tweeting -'Modi has thrashed us! Modi has thrashed us!' We didn't give this news to the world. They had informed the world about it.
During the surgical strike, we had informed the nation and this time as we followed the new methodology, they started sobbing. They were thinking about continuing with their attacks and proxy wars on India and expected India to be silent. The previous governments are responsible for this image of India that has been created before the country's enemies. These 'remote controlled' governments had such an attitude that the enemies were habituated to it.
Friends,
India can never forget that terrorists from Pakistani soil had launched terrorist attacks in Mumbai on 26/11 i.e., 26.11.2008. Could we ever forget? At that time wasn't there a crying need to take some steps? The world would have stood beside us or not? It requires will power friends! We had all evidences against the terrorists in Pakistan. All the evidences were proving them guilty.
But what did India do? How did it retaliate? We also have the information that at that time our army, our air force and navy were ready to take revenge.
The blood of our defence forces was boiling, but Delhi got cold feet. Permission was not granted to our defence forces. Their hands and legs were shackled. Can we fight against terrorism with such shackles? If we ask the soldiers with fretters to attack the enemies, will they be able to do that? Could the nation be protected in this way? Should we be soft towards the country's enemies?
Friends,
This was the reason that terror attacks across the country continued even after the Mumbai attacks. Recall - in 2010, there was a bomb blast in a bakery in Pune. In the same year, there was a bomb blast in a Ghat of Varanasi. In 2011, there were bombings in Mumbai again in Opera House, Zaveri Bazar and Dadar. In the same year, there were blasts outside Delhi High Court.
Similarly, in 2013, there was a bomb blast in a crowded market of Hyderabad. There had been bombings one after the other and thousands of innocent people were being killed and injured. These terror attacks too had a link across the border. But what did the previous government do? Those people didn't change their policy at all. They only changed their Home Ministers. Should the policy change or the Home Minister?
Friends,
Had the previous government shown its power and given a befitting reply to the terrorists in their language, then today the terror wouldn't have grown to such gigantic levels. After the 2016 surgical strike and the airstrike of February this year, the terrorists have understood that this is not the old India.
After the action taken by India, they are scared. The defence forces of India, the brave soldiers are doing their job but as the citizens of the country, it is our responsibility to remain alert. We should defeat every such force that is trying to divide the nation and is conspiring attacks against India. We must keep an eye on such people too.
Brothers and sisters,
The citizens of the country should pay attention to one more thing. Today there are people within the country who consider themselves as great political leaders, who once were in power. They are speaking such language which is empowering the enemies. These people are giving controversial statements. Questions are being raised against the bravery of the Indian soldiers while Pakistan is celebrating it. Whether the public should show these people the right path or not? Will you show them the right direction?
Brothers and sisters,
What kind of people are they? Identify them. Identify this 'split-up' gang. Pakistan itself had made a statement; in the beginning Pakistan only tweeted that Indian forces had thrashed them in their territory. This is their statement. By 7-8a.m. in the morning, a few idiots in our country had started - where is Balakot? Etc. You must have seen it. It was on television. You can go and see on YouTube. It was there in online magazines. It was not even 3-4 hours after the incident.
Pakistan was saying - 'we have been attacked. Modi came, thrashed us and went back!' while these people here had started asking at 7-8a.m. in the morning -'Is Balakot in India or in Pakistan?' 'Is Balakot on Indian border?' 'Is Balakot on Pakistan Occupied Kashmir or close to our Kashmir?' Investigation was going on and Pakistan was wailing whereas these people here were trying to help them. These people here were ready to mislead the country. Three hours later when it was confirmed that indeed Modi had gone there and came back, it was then that they fell silent. Otherwise for the 4-5 hours they had been going on with the same questions.
What is more! The Indian army was telling this; Pakistan was crying; should there be any doubt in the minds of the Indians? Should there be doubt in the minds of those whose veins have Indian blood? Should that person doubt who loves the Indian tricolour? Should that person doubt who says 'Bharat Mata ki Jai'? Who are those people who doubt? Will you trust such people?
Therefore I keep on saying brothers and sisters that we have been relentlessly working towards strengthening the foundation of New India since 2014. We have worked towards fulfilling the needs of the country and delivering the basic amenities to the people. Now, it is time to fulfil the aspirations of the people. We have laid the foundation stone of New India over the last 5 years and now in the coming years we will build a glorious India on it. We will build such an India that is successful, capable and secure.
Friends,
The world that is witnessing the power of New India; the visible changes in the policies and work culture that are being witnessed; who is behind all that? You are behind it, the power of 125 crore Indians and your blessings! With this belief that your blessings will always be upon me, with this spirit, I congratulate you all from the bottom of my heart. Thank you! Say along with me-
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
With both your fists in the air, say loudly-
Vande Mataram!
Vande Mataram!
Vande Mataram!
Thanks a lot.
