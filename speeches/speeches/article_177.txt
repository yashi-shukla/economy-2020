Greetings to all!
This is the first session of 2020. This is also the first session of this decade. We must strive to turn this session into a strong foundation for a bright future of this decade. Today, the Hon'ble President will address the Parliament and tomorrow this year's budget will also be presented. Let this session focus upon maximum possible economic issues and the way by which India can take advantage of the global economic scenario. Strengthening its economic activities, India should get the maximum benefits of the global conditions.



 



 



Our government has been identified with the empowerment of the oppressed, the exploited, the deprived classes and women. We will be focussing upon the same in this decade too. And I would like to have a much wider and a better discussion on the economic issues and empowerment of people in both the Houses. And the quality of our discussion must become more enriched over the days. With this belief, I thank you all very much. Namaskar!
