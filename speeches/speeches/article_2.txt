We have reduced our emission intensity by 21% over 2005 levels: PM
Our solar capacity has grown from 2.63 GigaWatts in 2014 to 36 GigaWatts in 2020: PM


Excellencies,
This Summit marks the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement - the most ambitious step in our fight against Climate Change. Today, as we are looking to set our sights even higher, we must also not lose sight of the past.We must not only revise our ambitions, but also review our achievements against targets already set.Only then can our voices be credible for future generations.
Excellencies,
I must humbly share with you, that India is not only on track to achieve its Paris Agreement targets, but to exceed them beyond expectations. We have reduced our emission intensity by 21% over 2005 levels. Our solar capacity has grown from 2.63 GigaWatts in 2014 to 36 GigaWatts in 2020. Our renewable energy capacity is the fourth largest in the world.
It will reach 175 GigaWatts before 2022. And, we have an even more ambitious target now - 450 GigaWatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. We have also succeeded in expanding our forest cover and safeguarding our biodiversity. And, on the world stage, India has pioneered two major initiatives:

The International Solar Alliance, and
Coalition  for Disaster Resilient  Infrastructure.

Excellencies,
In 2047, India will celebrate 100 years as a modern, independent nation. To all my fellow residents of this planet, I make a solemn pledge today. Centennial India will not only meet its own targets, but will also exceed your expectations.
 
Thank you.
