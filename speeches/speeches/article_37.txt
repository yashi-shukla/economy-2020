I feel extremely blessed to have got the opportunity to talk to all of you. And the people of Varanasi are also benefiting from the development work in the city and the decisions taken by the government. And it is possible due to the blessings of Baba Vishwanath. Hence, even though I am virtually present there, we cannot go ahead without emulating the tradition of Kashi. Therefore, whoever is associated with me in the programme, we will all say together - Har har Mahadev! Greetings to all on Dhanteras, Deepavali, Annakoot, Govardhan Puja and Chhat puja! May mother Annapurna bring you prosperity! Let there be more splendour in the markets. Let there be hustle & bustle in the streets of Kashi; let the business of Varanasii sarees also shine brighter! Even while fighting against Corona, our farmers have paid great attention to farming. This time, there has been a bumper crop production in the entire Purvanchal including Varanasi. The hard work of the farmers has not only been for themselves but also for the entire country. The hard work of anna-data is highly appreciative. The popular Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Shri Yogi Adityanath ji, Deputy Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Shri Keshav Prasad Maurya ji, Ministers of UP Government, MLAs, all the elected public representatives of Varanasi, my dear brothers and sisters of Varanasi who have joined me in the programme!
With Mahadev's blessings, Kashi never stops. It keeps moving forward like mother Ganga. Even during the difficult times of Corona, Kashi continued to grow in this form. The spirit in which Varanasi has fought against Corona and the social cohesiveness that has been demonstrated in this difficult times is truly admirable. Today projects worth thousands of crores of rupees related to the development of Varanasi are inaugurated and the foundation stones are being laid. Well, this too is because of the blessings of Mahadev that whenever some new project is being started for Kashi, several old projects are already completed by then. That is, laying the foundation stone of a project on one hand and the inauguration on the other. Even today, while 16 schemes worth about Rs 220 crore are being inaugurated, the work has been started on 14 schemes worth around Rs 400 crore. I congratulate the people of Varanasi for all the development projects. In Kashi, Uttar Pradesh, the credit for these ongoing development works goes to Chief Minister Shri Yogi Adityanath ji and his entire team - my cabinet colleagues, elected representatives, and everyone associated with the government machinery. Heartiest congratulations and best wishes to Yogi ji and his team for this determined effort of public service.



Friends,
In the development plan of the city and rural areas of Varanasi, tourism, culture as well as roads, electricity & water should also be there. Every effort will be made to ensure that the wheel of development moves according to the desire of every person of Kashi. Therefore, this development in itself is an example of how Varanasi is moving rapidly in every field and in every direction. From cleanliness of Mother Ganga to health services, from road and infrastructure to tourism; from electricity to sports for youth, and from farmer to village-poor, Varanasi is gaining a new momentum for development. Today, the renovation of the sewage treatment plant under the Ganga Action Plan project has been completed. The foundation-stone of the diversion line has also been laid to prevent excess sewage water from the Shahi Nala flowing into the Ganges. At a cost of more than 35 crores, the Khirkiya ghat is also being renovated. Here, the boats will run on CNG, which will reduce pollution in the Ganges. Similarly, the Tourist Plaza at Dashashwamedh Ghat will also become a centre of tourist attraction and convenience in the coming days. This will also enhance the beauty of the ghat and the facilities too will increase. These plazas will help the local small businesses in increasing their customers and convenience.
Friends,
This effort and commitment towards Mother Ganga, is not only the resolve of Kashi but also the way to new possibilities for Kashi. Gradually, the image of the ghats here is changing. When the number of tourists increases after the impact of Corona wanes, they will return with a more beautiful impression of Varanasi. Apart from the cleanliness and beautification of the Ganga Ghats, Sarnath too is getting a new look. The light and sound programme launched today will add to the grandeur of Sarnath.
Brothers & Sisters,
A major problem of Kashi has been the dangling electric wires. Today, a large area of Kashi is also being freed from the network of dangling electric wires. Another phase of laying underground wires has been completed today. Dangling electrical wires have been removed from 7 routes such as from Cantt station to Lahurabir, Bhojubir to Mahabir Temple, Kachahari Chauraha to Bhojubir Tiraha. Moreover, smart LED lights will also add brightness and beauty to the streets.



Friends,
The connectivity of Varanasi has always been a top priority of our government. New infrastructure is being developed for Kashi residents and every tourist coming to Kashi. None of the devotees' time should be wasted in traffic jams. Facilities are improving at the airport today in Varanasi. The road connecting Babatpur to the city has also become a new identity of Varanasi. These facilities will expand further after the launch of two Passenger Boarding Bridges at the airport today. This extension is also necessary because 6 years ago, that is, before you gave me the opportunity to serve you, 12 flights used to run every day in Varanasi; Today it has increased by 4 times i.e. 48 flights. That is, seeing the expansion of facilities in Varanasi, the number of people coming to Varanasi is also increasing.
Brothers & Sisters,
The modern infrastructure being developed in Varanasi is making life easier for both the people who live here and who come here. Varanasi today is also looking at rejuvenating the road infrastructure, be it the connectivity with the airport, the ring road, the Mahmoorganj-Manduadih fly over or the widening of the NH-56. The face of the roads in the city and in the surrounding areas has also transformed. Even today, the work for road construction in different areas of Varanasi has begun. There are so many projects such as the construction of National Highway, Phulwariya-Lahartara road, 3 bridges over Varuna River and several roads, which are going to be completed very soon in the coming days. Besides this network of roadways, Varanasi is also becoming a model in connectivity of waterways. The first inland water port of the country has been built in Varanasi.



Brothers & Sisters,
In the last 6 years, unprecedented work has also been done on health infrastructure in Varanasi. Today Kashi is becoming a hub of healthcare facilities not only for UP but for the entire Purvanchal too. Today, this role of Kashi has expanded with the inauguration of projects related to the modernization of Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital in Ramnagar. Facilities like Mechanized Laundry, systematic registration counter and residential premises for employees will now be available in the hospital of Ramnagar. Major cancer institutes like Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Pandit Mahamana Malaviya Cancer Hospital are already providing services here. Similarly, ESIC Hospital and BHU Super Specialty Hospital are also giving better health care facilities to the poorest of the poor & pregnant women here.
Friends,
With the all-round development that is taking place in Varanasi today and development of every sector here, the entire eastern India including Purvanchal is benefitting a lot. Now the people of Purvanchal do not have to travel to Delhi and Mumbai for small needs. Many facilities ranging from storage to transport have been developed here for the farmers of Varanasi and Purvanchal, in the recent years. Farmers are benefiting a lot from facilities such as the Centre for International Rice Institute, Milk Processing Plant and the construction of the Perishable Cargo Centre. It is also a matter of pride for us that for the first time this year fruits, vegetables and paddy from the Varanasi region have been exported abroad. To expand the storage facilities meant for farmers, a Store-house with a capacity of 100 metric tonnes has been inaugurated today in Kapsethi. Apart from this, a multi-purpose seed godown and dissemination Centre has also been built in Jansa.
Brothers & Sisters,
The village-poor and farmers are also the biggest pillars and the greatest beneficiaries of the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. The agricultural reforms that have taken place in the recent past will benefit the farmers directly, and will ensure direct connectivity to the market. Middlemen and brokers who used to usurp the hard work of farmers are now being pushed out of the system. Every farmer of Uttar Pradesh, Purvanchal and Varanasi will get the direct benefits of the same.
Friends,
Just like for the farmers, a very ambitious scheme has been started for the street-vendors. Today, under the Pradhan Mantri Svanidhi Yojana, the street vendors are getting easy loans. The problems they faced due to Corona can be overcome; their work can be started again. They are being given a loan assistance of Rs 10,000 each for the same. Similarly, 'Swamitva Scheme' has been launched to give legal rights of the rural land and house to the people living in the villages. In the villages, there used to be disputes related to house and land; sometimes people were killed. Sometimes a person away for a marriage used to find his house occupied by someone else on return. There will be no scope for such troubles with the receipt of property cards under the Swamitva scheme. Now, with the property card for your house or land in the village, you will also get a loan from the bank. At the same time, the game of illegal possession of land will also be over. Purvanchal and Varanasi are going to receive huge benefits of these schemes.
Friends,
Our scriptures say - 'काश्याम् हि काशते काशी, काशी सर्व प्रकाशिका'। That is, Kashi lights up Kashi and Kashi lights up everything else. Therefore, the light that is being spread today & the change that is taking place, are a result of the blessings of Kashi and the residents of Kashi. The blessing of Mahadev is due to the blessing of Kashi, and with the blessings of Mahadev, even the toughest task becomes easy. I believe that with the blessings of Kashi, this river of development will continue to flow like this. With these best wishes once again heartiest greetings to all of you on Deepawali, Govardhan Puja and Bhaiya Dooj.
And I have one more request to you. Nowadays you can see, 'Vocal for Local'. Now, the mantra of 'Local for Diwali' too is echoing everywhere. I also tell the people of Varanasi and the countrymen to promote 'local for Diwali' campaign as much as possible. Then these things will go far and wide if the people know how wonderful they are and what our identity is! This will not only strengthen the local identity, but Diwali will also brighten the lives of the people who make these goods. That is why before Diwali, I am urging the people of the country again and again to be vigilant for the 'local' products. You see a new energy will be infused in the entire economy. The products that smell the sweat of my countrymen and reflect the wisdom of the youth of my country are the products that give many families in my country the power to expand their work by taking new resolutions with a renewed vigour and enthusiasm. It is my duty as an Indian towards my countrymen. I am committed to every product of my country. With this spirit, come let us be vocal for the local. Celebrate Diwali with local, not just lamps. Some people think that local means diyas or lamps. No, it means everything, every other product. If a product is not manufactured in our country at all, then of course we have to buy a foreign product. Also, I am not asking you to throw away an already purchased foreign product. I just want to say that it is our responsibility to support the people of our country who are working hard & the youth of my country who are trying to do something new with their intelligence, strength and ability. We all have a responsibility. Purchasing their product elevates their courage. You see, a new class will be created which is full of confidence, which will take India to greater heights. That's why I am once again talking to my Kashivasis today. Whenever I have asked Kashi to do something, whatever I have demanded from the people of Kashi, they have given me wholeheartedly; but I have never asked anything for me, nor do I need anything. Although you have not left out anything, I am vocal for every need of Kashi and everything that is being developed in Kashi. I feel proud of the same and I try to take it to every household. It is my request that everything in my country gets an opportunity. Once again I salute the people of Kashi, bowing down at the feet of Kashi Vishwanath ji, Kaal Bhairava, and mother Annapurna. I wish you all the very best for the upcoming festivals.
Thanks a lot!
