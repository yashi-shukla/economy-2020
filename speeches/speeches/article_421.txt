Shri Yogi Adityanath ji, the popular and successful Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh; my Cabinet colleague and the Defence Minister of India, Nirmala Sitharaman ji; my Cabinet colleague sister Smriti Irani ji; Minister in the State Government Mohsin Raza Ji and Suresh Pasi Ji, MLA Mayankeshwar Sharan Singh ji, Garima Singh ji, Dal Bahadur Kori ji, my dear brothers and sisters of Uttar Pradesh. Jay Ram ji! How are you all doing? Hope everything is alright!
You all have gathered here in such large numbers, my salutations to you all! This had been the Tapobhumi of Tikarmabhi Maharaj of Amethi. This is the land of the writer of Jaimina Mahapuran, Baba Purushottam Das ji. This is the land of Malik Mohammad Jayasi. This land has been the land of the National President of Arya Samaj. I salute this land.
Today I have come here to extend our government's development programmes in Amethi. And today even 'Meghraja' (The Rain God) has been kind to us and has welcomed us. I clearly remember that in the year 1998, I had accompanied Atal ji to attend a public meeting here. Even at that time, it had rained heavily. Since then, I had been visiting Amethi for some or the other work related to the party. After I became the Prime Minister, once again I have got the opportunity to be present amidst you all today.
During the 2014 elections, we had raised the slogan of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. My dear brothers and sisters of Amethi, Amethi is the best example that showcases the essence of our mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'. When we talk of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas', I used to say and I still say that those who had voted for us are ours and those who hadn't voted for us too ours. The region that has given us a seat is ours and the region that has not given us a seat too is ours.


And after 5 years, bowing my head before the people of Amethi, I can proudly say that sister Smriti Irani ji had stood before you as the candidate here. She was a new face and a new identity for you all but you all had showered your blessings on her. Even though we couldn't win from here at that time in the elections but we were successful in winning your hearts. With your love, Smriti ji had worked really hard for the development of Amethi during the last 5 years. She never ever felt whether you had elected her or defeated her. She has worked more than the winner. I want to ask the people of Amethi - Are you satisfied with our work? Did you feel that we were always concerned for you? Have we honestly strived for your welfare? Have we done even the slightest injustice to you? Did we do complete justice? This is our mantra of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas'.
Just a short while ago, projects worth crores of rupees related to the development of Amethi have been inaugurated or their foundation stones have been laid. These include projects related to schools, roads, medical centers, cattle breeding, electricity and several others related to farming.
Brothers and Sisters,
Besides these projects, today I am going to make a very important announcement. This announcement is related to the new identity and glory of Amethi. Several great leaders might have come here; Amethi will not be known by the name of those leaders. It will be known by the scheme I have brought today.
Brothers and sisters,
Now one of the most latest, the most modern rifles AK 203 which is also known as Kalashnikov will be manufactured in Korba Ordnance Factory, Amethi. These rifles will be manufactured by a joint venture of Russia and India. Just a short while ago, our country's first woman Defence Minister Nirmala Ji has read the message of President of Russia here. I express my gratitude to President Putin, a very close friend of mine and of India for this partnership. This joint venture has been possible in a very short span of time due to his cooperation. I am very grateful to President Putin for his friendly message and good wishes; I also thank and congratulate Russian friends associated with this joint venture and my best wishes to everyone for its success.



Friends,
A few people go into villages and talk about- made in Ujjain, made in Jaipur, made in Jaisalmer, made in Baroda. Their speeches just remain speeches. But this is Modi. The AK 203 rifles 'Made in Amethi' will definitely enhance the strength of our soldiers during their encounters with the terrorists and Naxalites. Now lakhs of these rifles will be manufactured in the factory of Amethi. The rifles manufactured here will be exported to other countries of the world in the future. Therefore, this factory of Amethi is going to open up employment opportunities for the youngsters and is going to open up a new path for development and security of the country.
Brothers and sisters,
The work will begin from today. This work should have started 8-9 years back. This factory of Korba was set up solely for the purpose of manufacturing modern rifles but it was not used to its full capacity. This factory at Amethi is an evidence of the fact that the needs of our Army and soldiers were neglected before.
Friends,
Our army had put forward the need for modern weaponry in front of the then government in 2005 for the sake of the country's security. During 2007, when its foundation stone was being laid, the Parliamentarian from here had said that the work would begin from 2010 onwards. Did that happen? Was it promised or not? Whatever was said, it should have happened or not? Why do you trust those who couldn't even do the bare minimum? But friends, let alone starting the work, the previous government couldn't even decide upon the types of weapons that would be manufactured in the Ordnance Factory. Moreover, even the land was not made available for the factory to be set up.
Friends,
Just imagine! The factory wherein the work should have been started in 2010 couldn't be set up till 2013. After the factory was built, work had started somehow because they had to show off before the elections. Yet, modern rifles were still not manufactured. And don't forget, they say that they keep their promises and never lie - this too is a big lie. And don't forget that they had promised to give employment to 1500 youngsters. They had promised to provide job to1500 people in the factory. I am talking about Amethi not the nation. But these people who make tall promises had befooled the people of Amethi and only 200 people got the jobs. Today they are delivering speeches regarding employment throughout the country.
My brothers and sisters of Amethi,
Now after waiting for so many years, one of the world's latest modern rifles will be manufactured in Amethi's Ordnance Factory.
Friends,
I want to ask you something. Wasn't it an injustice done to our brave soldiers by not manufacturing the modern rifles? Was it an injustice or not? Wasn't it an injustice done to the resources by not utilizing the Ordnance Factory to its full capacity? Wasn't it an injustice done to the youngsters of Amethi by not providing them with employment?




Friends,
The previous government had left no stone unturned in neglecting the safety of the Defence forces. It is essential to remind the nation about how our brave soldiers were kept waiting for bullet-proof jackets. In 2009, the Army had demanded 1 lakh 88 thousand bullet-proof jackets. Our soldiers were fighting against the bullets of the enemy forces and terrorists without the bullet-proof jackets. They were engaging in life-threatening encounters with the terrorists putting their lives at stake. They didn't purchase the bullet-proof jackets even within 5 years from 2009 to 2014. Five years are not less. It was our government that ordered more than 2 lakh 30 thousand bullet-proof jackets during the last four and a half years.
Today as I have visited Amethi, I wish to know from you all that who were those people who had made our brave soldiers wait for rifles and bullet-proof jackets? Who were those people? I won't take names but you all are well aware of their identities. Therefore, brothers and sisters - Bharat Mata ki Jai! You know them and I don't have to name them.
Brothers and sisters,
Not only modern rifles and modern bullet-proof jackets but the same people had made the nation wait for modern cannons as well. This is our government that has signed a deal for modern cannons and now these are being manufactured within India.
Friends,
Just like modern cannons, our Air Force had been demanding modern fighter aircrafts for several decades. But how could those with wrong intentions hear the voices of the Air Force? They kept on sitting on the Rafael deal for years! While the government was leaving they had just shelved the deal. It is due to the efforts of our government that the first Rafael aircraft will be in the skies of India in a few months. But these people are still trying to create obstacles in the Rafael deal and are trying to thwart our efforts for their personal interests.
Brothers and sisters,
Every institution from the Supreme Court to the CAG saying that the Indian government has made the right decision at the right time and has done the right deal in the country's interest. But these people are continuously spreading lies. The frustration of not being able to get commission in defence deal could be clearly seen on the faces of a few people.



Friends,
Just like their half-hearted attempts towards the nation's security and negligence of the country's safety, they have also behaved in a similar way with the people of Amethi. What promises were made to Amethi? Whereas what's the actual condition of Amethi today? No one knows that better than you all!
Brothers and sisters,
This is the result when there is a lack of intention and willpower to do something for the welfare of the poor and instead just lies are spread. Try to recall, the steel plant located here had to be shut down because there was no arrangement for gas. The same thing happened to the Meghapur Food Park here. So, when we thought of the steel factory, we arranged for the gas. Now this steel factory is ready to give jobs to Amethi and to further increase the steel production in the country.
Brothers and sisters,
The cycle factory of Goliganj that was supposed to be set up had met with a similar fate. They took away the land of the farmers but didn't set up the factory and fraudulently took over the ownership of the land. In the name of development of Amethi, your feelings have been played with this way.
Friends,
When self-interest lies only in power and propagating the family's name becomes the only goal, then it is quiet natural that the needs of the country will be neglected. When welfare of the family and relatives becomes the priority, then the feeling of working for the welfare of the common man ends. Unfortunately, this is what has happened in Amethi.
I was watching one TV report, wherein a report on a Dalit village here was shown. It was told that the houses that were given to the Dalits in 2008 were on the verge of crumbling down within the span of 10 years. The people living there were saying that although the MP had given his name to that residences, but had forgotten the people after that.
Friends,
You are a witness to the treatment that was meted out to the people of Amethi. And you can clearly see how our government has worked towards the development projects here.
More than 9000 houses have been constructed in Amethi under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Efforts have been made to make the lives of the people here easier by giving free gas connections under the Ujjwala scheme, by providing free electricity connection under Saubhagya scheme and by constructing toilets.
Brothers and sisters,
Forgetting the people after garnering votes is the habit of a few people. They want to keep the poor perpetually under poverty for generations so that they could keep on raising the slogans of 'Garibi Hatao'. We are trying to empower the poor so much so that they could come out of the poverty at the earliest. This is the reason why today India is considered among those nations where poverty is getting reduced at a rapid pace. A few people do not have sensitivity towards the poor at all.
Friends,
The treatment that was meted out to the poor, the farmers too met with a similar fate. These people had never tried to empower the farmers. They kept on neglecting their all kinds of needs. If the farmers were exasperated by their schemes, they would trap the farmers into the delusion of loan waivers. Last time in 2008, they had waived the loans of only Rs.52 thousand crores while the country's farmers had a debt of Rs.6 lakh crores.
Moreover, the benefits of the loan waivers reached 3 to 3.5 crore farmers of the country on an average, i.e. if there are 100 farmers in your village, hardly 20-25 farmers could avail the benefit. The rest of the benefits were taken away by their contractors, brokers and middlemen. On the other hand, the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme of our government will benefit 12 crore farmers of the country. A few days back, the first installment of Rs.2000 has already reached the bank accounts of crores of farmers. Those who have not yet received the money will soon get the benefit.
Friends,
This scheme is so massive that in the coming 10 years, Rs.7.5 lakh crores will be delivered to the farmers’ accounts directly. Just imagine! The villages, farmers and the rural economy of the country will be empowered to a great extent! This will also benefit thousands of farmers of Amethi. He would be able to do a lot of things like purchasing fertilizers, seeds and pesticides or paying electricity bills with the help of this money.
Brothers and sisters,
Your Prime Servant is able to work for you, the farmers, the soldiers or our country's young sons and daughters because of your blessings and strength. Looking at your enthusiasm I can say that Amethi and the people of Amethi are going to create a new history; a history whose echo will be heard all over the country.
Friends,
I also give special thanks to Smt. Smriti ji for the development of Amethi. Once again, I also thank the Russian President Putin ji whose message was read by the country's first lady Defence Minister Nirmala ji. Now the world has clearly understood the women power. The nation that has a woman Defence Minister has clearly shown the world how steps should be taken for the security of the nation.
Once again, I express my gratitude to this huge wave of people in Amethi that has gathered here to bless me. Say along with me -
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Thanks a lot!!
