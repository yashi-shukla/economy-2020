Your courage and valour are inspiring the whole new generation and therefore your valour, your courage and what you have done will continue to inspire our younger generation and our countrymen for a long time to come. Considering the global situation, a message has gone to the world about the valour shown by you brave-hearts. The way you stood up to the powers, the world wishes to know who are these brave-hearts? What has been their training? How lofty their sacrifice is? How commendable is their commitment! The world is analyzing your bravery.
