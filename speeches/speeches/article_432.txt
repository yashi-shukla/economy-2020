Our soldiers have been the first line of defence, both against enemies, and against natural disasters: PM Modi
Today New India is growing in stature globally, and this is due in large measure to its Armed Forces: PM
Union Government has fulfilled its pledge of providing One Rank, One Pension to the soldiers and ex-servicemen: PM


Minister of Defense Nirmala Sitharaman ji, Minister of State for Defense Shri Subhash Bhamre ji, this Prime Servant salute all of you who have gathered here from every corner of the country.
All of you are not ex-existent, rather unprecedented, because due to the bravery and dedication of millions of soldiers like you, today our army is one of the most powerful forces in the world. The tradition that you have established with your valour and dedication in the world's largest democracy, is unparalleled. Whenever our country is threatened either by the enemies or by natural calamities, our soldiers have always faced the crisis first. They have always accepted the challenge first and have always provided a befitting reply. When Lata didi had sung -'ae mere watan ke logon' song here, crores of Indians had shed tears.
Friends,
From this historic place, I pay my tribute to the brave sons who were martyred in Pulwama, who had sacrificed everything. On this occasion, I salute every brave heart of the nation who is determined in every crisis and difficult situation.

Friends,
New India is moving ahead with a new methodology and a new policy and is defining its role at the international platform. This has been possible due to the great contribution of your valour, discipline and dedication. I am extremely delighted that just in a short while from now, yours and the nation's decade-long wait will come to an end. After seven decades of independence, a National War Memorial built in the memory of those who had laid down their lives for Mother Bharati is being dedicated to them. Names of thousands of soldiers are engraved on this Memorial that will inspire the country's present and the future generations for nation building and service to the nation.
Friends,
There had been a persistent demand for National War Memorial for several decades. Efforts had been made a couple of times in the past decades but nothing substantial was done in this regard. With your blessings, we started the process of building the National War Memorial four years ago and it has been completed before the stipulated time and will be inaugurated today. All of you have created a wonderful memory for the nation.
Friends,
This Memorial is also a symbol of how a resolution is accomplished. I had made a similar resolution before you for One Rank One Pension. You had to struggle a lot and launch movements during the tenure of previous governments. The nation is a witness to the same. Now the nation and you all are witnesses to the fact that not only has the One Rank One Pension been implemented but so far Rs.35 thousand crore has been distributed by our government. The government's pension budget has increased from Rs.44 thousand crores to more than Rs.1 lakh 12 thousand crores. Just imagine! There was a government that wanted to implement One Rank One Pension with just Rs.500 crores.
Friends,
There has been an increase of 40% in your pension with One Rank One Pension. Moreover, there has been an increase of 55% in the salaries of present army-men in comparison to the year 2014. Besides, the government is also taking care of other facilities for the former army personnel. An online system is being created to ensure that you don't have to visit government offices for complaints related to Pension. Similarly, our government has made another provision. If a soldier is stationed at Line of Control or at international border and if they get hurt due to natural calamities, accidents, floods or storms or landslides or are martyred while fighting against the enemies, then that soldier as well as his family will be entitled to pension.
You have been demanding super specialty hospitals for a long time. On this historic occasion, I get opportunity to inform you that we are going to set up not just one but three super specialty hospitals.



Friends,
When the nation's soldier is empowered, then the nation too is empowered. The nation's will power is formed by its security. Therefore, our soldiers, the army men are the focus of our efforts, ideas and approach. Due to this mindset and approach, for the first time, more than 57 thousand non-combatant posts have been converted into combatant posts. Due to this approach and in order to enhance the capacity of the soldiers, the excess burden of work like that of dairy farm is being removed. And due to this approach, during the celebrations of Army day, Navy Day and Air Force day, encouraging innovations by our soldiers is an inseparable part of the programme. We have also launched a portal for Gallantry awards on 15th August 2017 to honour the soldiers and so that the nation's children are made aware of their valour and indomitable courage.
Participation of each section of the society is indispensable for the nation's security. Naturally participation should be there. With this idea, for the first time women got the opportunity to be fighter pilots. Decisions have been taken to strengthen the participation of daughters in the Indian Army. Steps are being taken for the recruitment of women up to 20% in the total core of the Military Police. The women officers appointed through the Short Service Commission will have the option of taking up Permanent Commission like their male counterparts.
Friends,
We are relentlessly working towards making the country's army self-reliant. The decisions which were once considered impossible are now being made possible. We have initiated a change in the entire ecosystem of defense production. From the licensing process to the export process, we are bringing transparency and level playing field to the whole system. We have also taken steps to encourage foreign investment in the defense sector. Now 49% of FDI is possible through automatic route and 100 per cent FDI has also been allowed in some areas.
We also made major changes in the Defense Procurement Procedure or the purchase of defense goods. Make in India is being promoted. You would be surprised to know that our private sector, which was hesitant to enter into defense production, is now making defense products three times more compared to 2014. We are striving to complete the Defense Procurement process in due time. For this, there has been an increase in the financial powers of the Ministry of Defense and service headquarters. And this is the first time that we have given freedom to the Ordnance Factories of our Ordnance Factory Board for loads of more than 250 non-core items. Now our armies can purchase these items from the private sector without any NOC i.e. No Objection Certificate.
Friends,
The strength of the Indian Army is being recognized and honored at a global level today; an army that raises weapons to establish peace. India is a country which has sent more than two lakh soldiers to 50 out of 70 major UN peacekeeping missions. India is a country that has lost most of the soldiers during these peacekeeping operations.
Brothers and sisters,
It is a proud moment for us as today the major nations of the world want to walk shoulder to shoulder with us in our efforts. This is the reason why in 2016 navies of 50 countries had participated in our international fleet review. This is the reason why every country wants to make an agreement on defense cooperation with us. That is why our armies are holding an average of 10 major Joint Exercises every year with the Allied forces.
Friends,
It is because of our global vision that the Indian defense forces have received altogether a different honour. Today the piracy in the Indian Ocean has almost exhausted, and a large share of credit goes to Indian military power and its international partnerships for the same. Amidst our efforts, it is also necessary to know how things were before. Most of you must be aware of it as well. But on this occasion today, I would like to once again repeat the same information before the nation. It is essential for the newer generations to know as well. Those who considered themselves as the framers of the country's destiny had not only done injustice to the brave sons and daughters of the nation but also had played with the security of the soldiers and the nation.
Friends,
In the year 2009, the army had demanded 1 lakh 86 thousand bullet proof jackets. Our soldiers were facing the bullets from the enemies without bullet proof jackets. They were in a dangerous situation of encountering the terrorists by putting their lives at stake.



Friends,
Between 2009 and 2014, 5 years were gone, but jackets were not purchased for the army. But our government has purchased more than 2 lakh 30 thousand bullet proof jackets in the last four and a half years. Now you tell me whether the sin of depriving our soldiers of a protective shield or bullet proof jackets was committed or not? This sin, this slur is on whom?
Friends,
A similar criminal negligence committed against our soldiers and security of the country has been on the rise. You are better aware of the previous government's attitude towards the army. The army and the security of the country was just a means of income. Perhaps they could not find any profit in commemorating the martyrs, so they thought it was easy to forget them.
Friends,
From Bofors to the Helicopter (scam), every investigation led to just one family and it tells a lot to us. The same people are trying hard to prevent Rafael aircrafts from reaching India.
Friends,
When the first Rafael of India will touch the skies in a few months from now, it will cripple their efforts and conspiracies.
Friends,
In order to strengthen the country's army, our government is equipping it with state-of-the-art aircrafts, helicopters, submarines, ships and other weapons. The decisions which were in limbo for several decades, ignoring the national interest, are now being taken on a priority basis. Our government has started buying and manufacturing modern rifles for the army in India. Recently, the government has ordered 72 thousand modern rifles. At the same time, our government purchased ammunition i.e. bombs and bullets worth Rs. 25 thousand crores in Mission Mode.
Friends,
For some people, the family is more important than the nation. Today the country will get the National War Memorial, but the National Police Memorial had a similar story. It is our government that had the privilege of building this memorial and dedicating to the nation. About two and a half decades back, the file of this Memorial had started. It had progressed a little during Atal ji's tenure but after his government went out of power, the situation was again the same.
Friends,
Today every soldier and every citizen of the country is asking - why such a treatment of our Martyrs, our heroes? Why such an injustice was done to the people of the country, the families of the Martyrs and the heroes who had dedicated their lives to the nation? What was the reason that prevented their attention towards such a Memorial for the Martyrs?
Brothers and sisters,
India first or family first? The difference between India first and family first is the answer to this question. From schools to hospitals, highways to the airports, from stadiums to the awards - the name of the same family was associated with everything. The adverse consequence of promoting the family's name was that the Indian history, the glory of India and it's traditions never got any importance. Therefore, after we got elected, we tried to change the situation in every possible way. Today our national heroes like Sardar Patel, Baba Saheb Ambedkar as well as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, have been associated with the pride of the nation and with the essence and identity of New India.

Friends,
I believe from the core of my heart that Modi is not important but the country's culture, values and history. People may or may not remember Modi but the austerity, dedication and valour of these great men should remain immortal for the sake of the people of India.
Several steps have been taken in the last four and a half years to make the lives of the families of ex-servicemen and martyrs easier. Many more decisions will be taken in the future. Now a strong government is before you, which can turn the impossible into possible. For the honour of the nation, for the honour of the heroes and for you and your family, your Prime Servant will always make decisions with regard to the national interest. The country's security, the progress of the country, the development of the country - these goals for me are so sacred that I am ready to fight every hardship, every conspiracy and every obstacle in my path.
Once again, I congratulate all the soldiers of the country, the families of the martyrs and all the people of the country for the National War Memorial. I salute one and all who has put his life at stake for the country, has dedicated his life to the country, who is living for the Tricolour and if he is Martyred will be covered in the Tricolour. While ending my speech, I call upon you all to say along with me -
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Bharat Mata ki Jai!
Vande Matram!
Vande Matram!
Vande Matram!
